Project
--------------
***here2help*** is a Help Desk web app designed for a hypothetical local migrant community group. Members (Clients) of the community struggle to find and negotiate with service providers as they work odd ours and lack the ability to effectively communicate in english. The volunteers who run ***here2help*** negotiate with service providers on their behalf organise quotes and book services.
